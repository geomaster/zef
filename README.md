# Zef

Zef will be a build system which hopefully solves many inherent problems in
current build systems. I have not used all of them and I do not claim they are
all bad or have issues, I just want to create a build system which is completely
aligned with my needs. Input from others is very welcome.

## The RFC

I currently only have an RFC outlining the basic design and principles behind
Zef. I invite everyone to comment on it and send pull requests. Once I am
confident I have developed a good design, I'll proceed to implement it. You can
see the RFC [here](Zef-Design-RFC.md).
