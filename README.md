# Zef

Zef is a build system I'm currently writing in which I hope to solve some
problems that I've been having with a lot of others before. I am writing it in
Lua, while the build scripts will most probably be in MoonScript or a DSL on top
of Lua. It is a [beta build system][1].

## Progress

Not much at the time being. If you're interested, you can check out the docs/
subdirectory, but I'm not always keeping those in sync as I iterate on zef and
its core ideas, so take everything with a grain of salt.

## Contribution

I'm not sure if anyone can contribute anything for now, as this is mostly inside
my head. But if you like the idea, feel free to shoot me an email (or submit a
pull request if you come across something that needs fixing).
